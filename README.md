# Video-Looper-in-Python
Simple video looper in python made in less than an hour with ChatGPT

I have made several multi-track video recordings the hard way of me my playing my self-designed instruments.  I have performed ABCDEFU by Gayle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huYJa2Du57g and All Things Bright And Beautiful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CycZwIM2c_s and even more on my Patreon page https://www.patreon.com/diydsp.  But those were very difficult to record.  I wish there was something smoother, a true video looper like my RC-505 does for audio.  I looked aroud and couldn't find one.  

I am an embedded firmware programmer (btw, looking for a job. DM me!) and have always thought of Python has the slower, cumbersome cousin of C/C++...  I never thought that it could handle video streams...especially for of them simultaneously.  Well anyway, I challenged ChatGPT to do it and it suggested OpenCV...  A few iterations later and here we go!  

Next Steps

First, I have to go to bed.  I have to get up early tomorrow and I'm still a little jet-lagged from traveling last week.  But then, I'm going to add the audio to this to make it a true audio/video looper!
